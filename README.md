Arkup's floating house is a double-decker yacht that doubles as a glassy modern house. Modular jack up barge crane dry dock. A FreeCAD workbench aiding in naval vessel design. Modelica is an object-oriented language developed to easily describe models of dynamic systems that can be very complex. Library for solar and geothermal district heating systems with seasonal storage. BuildSysPro open source: EDF's Modelica library for buildings, districts and energy systems modelling. Modelica Buildings library. A Modelica model library for building performance simulations. Free (standard conforming) library to model mechanical (1D/3D), electrical (analog, digital, machines), magnetic, thermal, fluid, control systems and hierarchical state machines. Also numerical functions and functions for strings, files and streams are included. IDEAS is a Modelica library for Integrated District Energy Assessment Simulations. Coselica Toolbox provides Xcos Modelica building blocks for modeling and simulation of electrical, mechanical, and thermodynamic systems. Modelica3D is a lightweight, platform independent 3D-visualisation library for Modelica. Toolchain that generates Modelica building models from BIM models. OpenStudio is a cross-platform collection of software tools to support whole building energy modeling using EnergyPlus and advanced daylight analysis using Radiance. EnergyPlus is a whole building energy simulation program that engineers, architects, and researchers use to model both energy consumption and water use in buildings. Seismo-VLAB (a.k.a SVL) is a simple, fast, and extendable C++ finite element software designed to optimize meso-scale simulations of linear and nonlinear wave-propagation and soil-structure interaction. PhasicFlow is a parallel C++ code for performing DEM simulations. DeepWave, a novel water wave simulation technique based on deep learning and wave packet theory
